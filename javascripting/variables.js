/*
A variable is a name that can reference a specific value. Variables are  
declared using let followed by the variable's name.  
 
Here's an example:  
 
   let example  
 
The above variable is declared, but it isn't defined (it does not yet  
reference a specific value).  
 
Here's an example of defining a variable, making it reference a specific  
value:  
 
   const example = 'some string'  
 
# NOTE  
 
A variable is declared using let and uses the equals sign to define the  
value that it references. This is colloquially known as "Making a variable  
equal a value".
*/

let example = 'some string'

console.log(example)
