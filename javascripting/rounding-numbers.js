/*
We can do basic math using familiar operators like +, -, *, /, and %.  
   
  For more complex math, we can use the Math object.  
   
  In this challenge we'll use the Math object to round numbers. 
  
We will use the Math.round() method to round the number up. This method  
  rounds either up or down to the nearest integer.  
   
  An example of using Math.round():  
   
     Math.round(0.5)  
*/

let roundUp = 1.5;
let rounded = Math.round(roundUp);

console.log(rounded)
